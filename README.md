# DndSheetAutomator
This is a simple program to automate my D&d sheet. Im using it as an initial project to apply what I am learning as I go.
It is currently very barebones and only works with my specific sheet. However as I learn more and have more time I will be adding more to it as well as making it work with a general template instead of only my specific sheet.
