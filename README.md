# DndSheetAutomator
This is a simple program to automate my D&d sheet. Im using it as an initial project to apply what I am learning as I go.
Currently the damage calculator and xp portions will work for any character. The attack claculator will work for any character that uses dex as their attacking stat.
Next update will make it so the attack calculator will work with all non spellcasters no matter what stat they use for their attack modifier.
