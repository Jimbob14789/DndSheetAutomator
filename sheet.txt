My luxurious life came to an end when my brother stole the woman I was courting and I attempted to kill him. My family exiled me to a far away land were I sought refuge in a monastery. I spent the next 15 years learning the ways of the warrior monks until I severally hurt another monk in a fit of anger during training. I now seek revenge on the monastery for their perceived wronging.
